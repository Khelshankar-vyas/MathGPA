# MathGPA
MathGPA (Gamified Practice &amp; Assessment) is a hybrid (digital and physical) learning tool aimed at strengthening foundational math skills for students from Pre-Primary to Upper Primary. The objective was to create an engaging and structured learning environment.
That addresses key challenges in early math education such as poor attention span, lack of consistent practice, and student disengagement.
